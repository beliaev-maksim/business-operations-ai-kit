### Initiative Approval Gates

**Before /plan execution:**
- objective.md complete with all sections
- OKR quality validated (SMART criteria met)
- Stakeholders identified (at minimum: Accountable role assigned)
- Initiative sizing within quarter (≤13 weeks estimated)

**Before /implement execution:**
- All readiness checklists complete (if present)
- Accountable stakeholder sign-off obtained
- Budget approval secured (or "proceed at risk" explicit approval)
- Resources committed (FTE availability confirmed)

### Documentation Standards

**Spec.md Requirements:**
- Strategic Context: Links to org-level OKRs or strategic goals
- Objective & Key Results: All KRs SMART-compliant
- Business Scenarios: P1/P2/P3 prioritization with rationale
- Stakeholders: RACI matrix complete
- Change Management: Magnitude assessed, adoption plan outlined
- Initiative Sizing: Atomicity assessment, breakdown if needed

**Plan.md Requirements:**
- Execution Strategy: Phasing approach, quality gates
- Resources: Budget, FTE, vendors/consultants
- Timeline: Milestones aligned to quarter
- Stakeholder Analysis: Power/Interest matrix, engagement strategy, readiness assessment
- Communication Plan: Touchpoints, messages, feedback mechanisms
- Training Design (if Moderate/Transformational change)

**Tasks.md Requirements:**
- Strict checklist format compliance (checkbox, ID, labels, deliverables)
- Phase structure: Setup → Foundational → Scenarios (S1, S2, S3) → Closure & Sustainment
- Scenario independence validated (each scenario has complete workflow)
- Validation tasks present for each scenario
- Dependencies documented

### Quality Standards

**OKR Quality:**
- Zero Key Results without baselines
- Zero KRs with unmeasurable verbs lacking quantified metrics
- All KRs have data source and measurement frequency defined

**Stakeholder Coverage:**
- 100% RACI coverage across all scenarios
- High-power/high-interest stakeholders have ≥2 engagement touchpoints
- End users (if process changes) have training AND validation tasks

**Task Completeness:**
- Every business scenario has validation tasks
- Approval workflows complete for policy/process changes
- Training delivery tasks present if >50 users affected
- Baseline measurement task if baseline unknown
- Sustainment tasks in final phase (knowledge transfer, continuous improvement)

## Governance Process

### Constitution Authority

This constitution is **NON-NEGOTIABLE** within initiative planning scope. 

**Constitution violations are automatically CRITICAL:**
- Initiative >1 quarter without breakdown → BLOCK planning
- KR not SMART-compliant → BLOCK planning
- No Accountable stakeholder → BLOCK execution
- High-risk with no mitigation → BLOCK execution

**Organizational Context Integration**:
- The constitution defines **governance rules** (what must be done)
- The `organization-context.md` file provides **environmental context** (how to apply rules effectively)
- **All commands** should reference organization-context.md to tailor recommendations
- Examples:
  - Constitution requires RACI matrix → Organization Context tells you who the actual stakeholders are
  - Constitution requires change management for Moderate/Transformational initiatives → Organization Context tells you the org's change readiness level and preferred communication channels
  - Constitution requires baseline measurement → Organization Context tells you what data sources and systems are available

**Amendment Process:**
- Constitution changes require explicit documentation of rationale
- Amendments must be approved at Director+ level
- Transition period defined for initiatives in-flight

### Compliance Validation

**/analyze command validates:**
- OKR quality (SMART criteria)
- Initiative sizing (quarter boundary)
- Stakeholder coverage (RACI completeness)
- Baseline measurement presence
- Change management integration
- Scenario validation completeness
- Risk mitigation planning

**Runtime Guidance:**
- All commands (specify, plan, tasks) enforce constitution principles
- Agent positioned as senior business consultant ensures compliance
- Proactive breakdown recommendations when sizing limits approached
